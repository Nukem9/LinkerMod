// Semantic version - see http://semver.org/

// The major difference between v1::Version and v2::Version is that v1 includes
// the build identifier when calculating precedence of versions (see
// http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0-rc.1.html points 10,11) while v2 omits the
// build identifier when calculating precedence of versions (see
// http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html points 10,11).
