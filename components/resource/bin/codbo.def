/*QUAKED light (0 1 0) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8) PRIMARY_OMNI PRIMARY_SPOT PRIMARY_SCRIPTABLE PRIMARY_NOSHADOWMAP
"def" sets which light definition asset to use; these are made in asset manager.  This controls the shape of the light falloff curve.
"radius" controls the cutoff distance of the light.  The light falloff texture maps its left side to the light origin and the right side to the radius.  The rightmost pixel in the falloff texture is assumed to be black.
"_color" sets the color of the light.  The biggest value gets scaled to 1; this means that 0.1 0.1 0.1 is the same as 1 1 1.
"intensity" controls how bright a light is when the falloff texture is pure white.  A value of 1 is fullbright; smaller values are dimmer.
"PRIMARY_OMNI" and "PRIMARY_SPOT", if checked, give the light higher quality lighting and dynamic shadows.  Only one primary light may affect each world surface.  They both require spotlight settings to control where dynamic shadows lie, but unlike normal spotlights, "PRIMARY_OMNI" lights do not get attenuated by angle from the spot direction.
"PRIMARY_SCRIPTABLE" makes a primary light show up as an entity to script.
"PRIMARY_NOSHADOWMAP" prevents a primary light from ever having a shadowmap.  This is implied by fov_outer > 120.

A light pointed at a target will be a spotlight facing the target.  They default to having a circle with 64 unit radius around the target.
"fov_outer" overrides the fov of a spotlight from the 64 unit circle around the target.  It is in degrees.  A value of 90 would go +/-45 degrees from center, for 90 degrees total.  The default is to use the target to set the fov.
"fov_inner" sets the fov of the inner cone.  Spotlights only fade with angle between fov_inner and fov_outer.  Fov_inner is the same units as fov_outer; it should always be less than fov_outer.  The default is 0.
"exponent" changes the falloff of the spotlight between "fov_inner" and "fov_outer".  The default value of 0 means there is no falloff.  A value of 1 gives linear falloff.  Higher integers give steeper falloffs.

"maxturn" sets how many degrees script is allowed to turn a PRIMARY_SCRIPTABLE light from its initial direction.
"maxmove" sets how many units script is allowed to move a PRIMARY_SCRIPTABLE light from its initial position.

SE2Dev START
"cut_on" Controls distance at which light will start
"falloffdistance" Distance at which inverse square distance attenuation starts to take effect.
"far_edge" Define the width of the transition region for cut-off, valid value is 0.0 to 1.0 which is mapped to equal the cuton and radius (cutoff) range.
"near_edge" Define the width of the transition region for cut-on, valid value is 0.0 to 1.0 which is mapped to equal the cuton and radius (cutoff) range. 
"roundness" Controls how rounded the corners of the superellipse for spotlights are. If the value is 0.0 the cross-section will be a perfect rectangle. If the value is 1.0, the cross-section will be a perfect circle. In between values control the roundedness of the corners in a fairly obvious way.
"superellipse" Controls the overall shape and feathering of the super-ellipse
"angle" Controls the angle of the projected light (used to rotate the projected light from a spotlight that has a roundness of less than 1.0).
